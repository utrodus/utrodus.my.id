I listen to podcasts more often lately, and sure enough, there is a lot of great information out there, especially in the software development world. There are amazing conversations, stories, and helpful insights from the developers.</p>\n<p>I love hearing different stories/opinions from software engineers I admire. From the technologies they use, the stack they use on their projects, or just tips and tricks. How they build this, how they do that. What software to use and whatnot. Their stories on successfully building a product, what the problems they usually encounter, what's hot and trending in the Javascript world, etc. Not to mention you get all this for free. All you need to have is a podcast app, search their podcast, and you're ready.</p>\n<p>Today, I would like to share some of the podcasts that I listen to regularly. This list consists mostly about software, back-end, and front-end engineering.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SyntaxFM</li>\n<li>FullstackRadio</li>\n<li>React Podcast</li>\n<li>Vue Official Podcast</li>\n<li>CodeNewbie</li>\n<li>Software Engineering Daily</li>\n<li>Views on Vue</li>\n<li>Laravel News Podcast</li>\n<li>CodeSwitch</li>\n<li>Breaking into Startups</li>\n<li>Android Central Podcast</li>\n<li>JS Party: Javascript and Web dev</li>\n<li>Shoptalk</li>\n<li>TED Talks Daily</li>\n<li>The Freecodecamp Podcast</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to stay updated on technologies, get inspired by the stories of successful developers, or want to optimize your time, listening to a podcast is beneficial not only to your career as a developer but also to your personal growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"happy-coding\"><a href=\"#happy-coding\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Happy Coding!</h2>\n","cover_image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/podcast-cover.a8ea3c5.d524e8562533a0f35b9eb108b1479bf4.jpeg","size":{"width":750,"height":500},"sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px","srcset":["/assets/static/podcast-cover.a8ea3c5.d524e8562533a0f35b9eb108b1479bf4.jpeg 750w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 750 500' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-94154f82b78a270495444e0f92510336'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='10'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-94154f82b78a270495444e0f92510336)' width='750' height='500' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b0yImSfH2MwZTtZChIH3PSin9oydpxml5lijtbutu0PIGSOFTrw0B3pQO2qfOKOMcQgKQT%2bOT2WEbA%2b/alYSUM9NunjuQt57ecrcryyN1Ipg/jeV4OJQ8ZHMbabQ9TyHVCuILqK9uxLCTojqGGiKl4SyMeKzttdzBmjXaEL394ap9DwqS7bxGJ316mnPP3jZLhbHRW7qyQxQ25XRBDlSeu/kO4pWtzvIXSrIqQbJlJ0fc5u4B7kb7U82EFuLUKyciR3UJCRxkkgRt3G/Pev35UQUJmPwVxFMkt7H4cCyITJzDp1/5U2ftLvJ5fJ3EKNMYy0jbce7GDrpvv28qac/mILVJrG5shd%2bOrQ27LLyi2OwU9wf6HmDvfN60OzqK0mHtICj3Dtzs2tL0O969O9c/wBTpazeAq8z1i%2bE9itcLj4pZhuW4BYyc3y38I%2bQpdDtyADrXIFSEAdqvhJEwO%2btdQIXlRF%2bInpW371ewESS5aBJBtdk99eRrB0qQz%2bC8zGFJGIKrzb0p33150xx5uK2sYeZxOkgU%2bzhztSuxtz9Cenn09KWboBbqZR2DkD81FSYN5LJwX97aPEnswRtuw6je%2bh166A/FTXeWWHPm6VOdETlTTaA33I/dL4/19K6hAZiG6jRolGtH//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"unsplash_author":"Jonathan Velasquez","unsplash_link":"https://unsplash.com/@jonathanvez"},"previous":{"title":"Deploy Plenti site on Netlify","path":"/post/deploy-plenti-site-on-netlify/"},"next":{"title":"Create a custom loading animation component in Nuxt.js with Lottie","path":"/post/create-a-custom-loading-animation-component-in-nuxt-js-with-lottie/"}},"context":{"previousElement":"0c10881d2129c3b95f55011a986c3cbe","nextElement":"b8b4b32b27b7b583696b9bc6fdd67782","id":"c59655380b03052cb0cb4916b5e57f44"}}
